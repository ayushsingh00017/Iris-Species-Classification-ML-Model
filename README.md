# Iris-Species-Classification-ML-Model
This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers into three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. The objective is to provide an accurate classification based on the features of the iris flowers.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand the relationships between different features and the target species.

Feature Engineering: Selecting the most relevant features to improve model performance.

Model Training: Implementing and training various machine learning models to find the best classifier.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model parameters to enhance classification accuracy.

Deployment: Providing scripts and guidelines for deploying the model into a production environment.
